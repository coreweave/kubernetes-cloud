# TensorFlow2 - Image Classifier

This example builds upon the components in the [GPT-2 Tensorflow](gpt-2/) example and deploys an Image Classifier exported using TensorFlow 2. The classifier leverages a small [transformer](gpt-2/transformer.md) to either accept a base64 encoded image or a url which is then downloaded by the transformer. Step by step instructions for this example are not available, we recommend you to apply the same methodolgy as in the [GPT-2 Tensorflow](gpt-2/) example, as the deployment steps are identical.

Please clone the manifests from [GitHub](https://github.com/coreweave/kubernetes-cloud/tree/master/online-inference/image-classifier) to get started.
