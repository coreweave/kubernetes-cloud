# CoreWeave Cloud

## Quick Links

* [**Kubernetes**](coreweave-kubernetes/getting-started.md) - Run and scale your own services and workloads with access to thousands of GPUs, CPU cores and high throughput networking in a fully managed Kubernetes environment.
* [**Inference**](compass/online-inference.md#introduction) - Production ML Model Deployment as a Service. Billed by the minute, with the industry's most responsive auto scale.
* [**Workflows**](workflows/argo.md#introduction) - Spin up batch training, rendering or general computation jobs on thousands of GPUs in seconds. Hyper responsive, only pay for the time your computations are running.
* [**Virtual Servers**](virtual-servers/getting-started.md) **-** Linux and Windows Virtual Servers with powerful GPUs, optionally pre-loaded with Teradici and Parsec remote desktop software.

## What is CoreWeave Cloud?

CoreWeave Cloud is not your regular, one-size fits all, cloud provider. Built from the ground up to support computationally intensive workloads, we provide the best tools for creators leveraging powerful accelerated hardware. We are not here to host your WordPress blog.

#### Accelerated Compute - At your fingertips

Our cloud is built around the GPU. A traditionally costly and scarce resource, GPU compute options from mono-lithic cloud providers are extremely limited. CoreWeave provides the industry's [widest range of GPU options](https://www.coreweave.com/pricing), allowing you to pick the perfect GPU for your use case. Thousands of GPUs are ready and waiting...

#### Scaling - The industries most responsive scaling

Unlike other cloud providers, your workloads execute on bare metal. When a container is deployed to CoreWeave Cloud, there are no minutes of wait time for Virtual Machines to spin up. Your workloads start executing in as little as 20 seconds. When they are done, billing stops immediately.

**Fully Managed - No maintenance and no control-plane charges**

You access compute using the Cloud UI, Workflows or directly as a Kubernetes namespace via [traditional Kubernetes tools](coreweave-kubernetes/getting-started.md#install-kubernetes-command-line-tools). We manage the control-plane, node availability and scaling. You submit your Models, Jobs or Deployments, we handle the rest.

#### Everything Else - The team and tools to make you successful

In addition to GPUs, CoreWeave provides [CPU-only nodes](coreweave-kubernetes/node-types.md#cpu-availability), local and persistent storage as well as all the bandwidth you might need to transfer your training sets, videos or molecular simulations. Our team is here to support you, readily available over E-Mail and Slack.
