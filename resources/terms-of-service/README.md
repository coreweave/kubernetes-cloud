# Terms of Service

**Last modified**: June 30, 2022

This page contains CoreWeave’s key Terms of Service and is a binding contract between CoreWeave and the Customer as of the creation of the Customer’s account on the CoreWeave Cloud Platform as a Covered Service, which also includes all of CoreWeave’s websites, services, products and solutions (the “CoreWeave Services”).

The TOS is a binding legal contract; the Customer’s acceptance of it is required to use CoreWeave Services. As such, the Customer may only use CoreWeave Services if the Customer agrees that it has read, understood, and consented to be bound by the TOS. By creating an Account and using CoreWeave Services, the Customer is representing to CoreWeave that:

* The creation of an Account and use of CoreWeave Services is in compliance with all laws, rules and regulations applicable to the Customer.
* In the case where the Customer is a natural person, they are (a) 18 years of age or older; and (b) have sufficient legal consent, permission and capacity to use CoreWeave Services in applicable jurisdiction(s) as determined by the Customer.
* In the case where a natural person is creating an Account and using CoreWeave Services on behalf of a company, organization, or other entity, in those cases, they have the authority to bind that company, organization or other entity to this TOS and they agree to be legally bound by this TOS on behalf of such entity.

There are other contractual documents that apply to the Customer’s use of the CoreWeave Cloud Platform as a Covered Service, and the terms contained in those documents are incorporated in these TOS. The Customer should review these other documents, which can be found by clicking at the links below:

* Data Processing Agreement (DPA), which contains the applicable terms for CoreWeave processing certain types of data on the Customer’s behalf. The Customer is responsible to determine and must alert CoreWeave immediately if the Customer is subject to any Data Protection Laws that require the Customer and CoreWeave to effectuate a DPA.&#x20;
* Acceptable Use Policy (AUP), which sets out prohibited uses of the CoreWeave Cloud Platform as a Covered Service, and which is effective at the time the Customer creates an Account.&#x20;
* Privacy Policy, which outlines how CoreWeave may collect, use and/or share Customer Data in connection with performing services.

### **Service Level Objectives**

CoreWeave provides the CoreWeave Cloud Platform as a Covered Service to the Customer at the following service level objectives (the "Service Level Objective" or "SLO")

| Covered Service               | Monthly Uptime Percentage |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Instances in Multiple Regions | >= 99.9%                  |
| Instances in a Single Region  | >= 99%                    |

If CoreWeave does not meet the SLO, and if Customer is otherwise in good standing and meeting its obligations, Customer will be eligible to receive the Financial Credits described below. This TOS states Customer’s sole and exclusive remedy for any failure by CoreWeave to meet the SLO. If CoreWeave authorizes the resale or supply of the CoreWeave Cloud Platform as a Covered Service under a CoreWeave Cloud partner or reseller program, then all references to Customer in this TOS shall mean Partner or Reseller (as applicable), and any Financial Credit(s) will only apply for impacted Partner or Reseller order(s).

Pursuant to the notice of deprecation posted on [status.coreweave.com](http://status.coreweave.com/) and communicated via email on June 30, 2022, there are no Financial Credits available as of August 1, 2022 for SLO failures in our EWR1 data center.&#x20;

### **Default Payment Terms and Billing**

All on-demand compute usage fees are subject to change.

For both prepaid rendering services and all other batch compute services performed on the CoreWeave Cloud Platform as a Covered Service, CoreWeave uses third-party payment processors (the "Payment Processors") to credit or bill Customer through the payment account(s) linked to the Customer’s account ("Billing Information"). The processing of credits or payments may be subject to the terms, conditions and policies of the Payment Processors in addition to this TOS. CoreWeave is not responsible for the acts or omissions of the Payment Processors. Customer agrees to purchase credits or pay all sums for services Customer uses at applicable prices in accordance with these pricing and billing policies and Customer authorizes CoreWeave and Payment Processors to deduct or charge all such sums (including all applicable taxes) based on the payment method(s) specified in or linked to the Customer’s account ("Payment Methods").

The Customer must provide current, valid, complete and accurate Billing Information for all Payment Methods linked to the Customer’s account, and must promptly update all such information in the event of changes (such as a change in billing address, credit card number, credit card expiration date or bank transfer and autopay information). Customer must promptly notify CoreWeave or the Payment Processors if a payment method is canceled (e.g., for loss or theft) or otherwise inoperable.

CoreWeave services other than prepaid rendering services will be billed monthly in arrears based on the Customer’s prior month’s usage, and unless agreed to otherwise with CoreWeave, all cloud services fees are due and payable upon receipt of invoice, which will be billed at the then current on-demand usage rates. All invoices under $20,000 will be automatically charged to the Customer’s credit card using the Payment Methods. All invoices for $20,000 or more must be paid by bank transfer (ACH or Wire) using the Payment Methods linked to a Customer’s account, payable on Net 15 days CoreWeave reserves the right to deactivate, terminate, prevent access to, disable services for, and/or suspend or delete a Customer’s account or access to any CoreWeave Services at any time for nonpayment, late payment (if applicable), or failure to maintain at all times current, valid, complete and accurate Payment Methods.

Fees for either Reserved Compute Instances or Bulk Credits are due and payable in accordance with the Order Forms therefore.

All fees for CoreWeave Services that are unpaid or past due for any reason are subject to a finance charge of 1.5% of the unpaid balance per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, whichever is lower) from the date such payment was due until the date paid. Customer will be responsible for all reasonable expenses (including attorneys’ fees) incurred by CoreWeave in collecting past due amounts. If any amount of your Fees are past due, we may suspend your API access after we provide you written notice of late payment. Any amounts due under this Agreement shall not be withheld or offset by you against amounts due to you for any reason.

Customer is responsible for any duties, customs fees, taxes, and related penalties, fines, audits, interest and back-payments relating to Customer’s purchase of any CoreWeave services, including but not limited to national, state or local sales taxes, use taxes, value-added taxes (VAT) and goods and services taxes (GST) (collectively, "Taxes"). Unless otherwise stated, CoreWeave’s pricing policies do not include and are not discounted or enhanced for any such Taxes. If CoreWeave becomes obligated to collect or pay Taxes in connection with the purchase of services, those Taxes will be invoiced as part of a billing process or collected at the time of purchase. In certain states, countries and territories, the purchase of CoreWeave services may be subject to certain Taxes, and if so, CoreWeave may collect such Taxes and remit them to the appropriate taxing authority. Customer must also provide any tax identification information that is necessary for compliance with these tax obligations. Customer is solely responsible for any misrepresentations made or non-compliance caused with respect to Taxes.

With respect to prepaid rendering credits, all credits are revocable or subject to early expiration for violations, including for abuse, misrepresentation of Billing Information, unauthorized transfer, or illegal conduct by the Customer.

With respect to either Reserved Compute Instances or Bulk Credits purchased by the Customer pursuant to an Order Form, if, at any time during the Term of the Order Form, Customer’s use thereof materially violates the TOS, CoreWeave may cancel the Order Form upon written notice to the Customer, such cancellation to be effective as of the last day of the month in which Customer’s violation occurred (the “Cancellation Date”), and CoreWeave may suspend Client’s use of the Reserved Compute Instances or Bulk Credits, as the case may be, immediately upon Client’s violation or CoreWeave’s discovery thereof. In the event that CoreWeave cancels an Order Form pursuant to the paragraph above, then Customer will be entitled to a refund equal to the prorated balance of the Purchase Price from the Cancellation Date through the end of the Term of the Order Form; provided, however, that Client’s committed utilization of Reserved Compute Instances or use of Bulk Credits, as the case may be, from the Effective Date through the Cancellation Date will be charged at CoreWeave’s on-demand rates then in effect and will offset any refund issued.

### **Customer Must Request Financial Credit**

In order to receive any of the Financial Credits described above, Customer must notify CoreWeave technical support within ten (10) days from the time Customer becomes eligible to receive a Financial Credit. Customer must also provide CoreWeave with server log files showing loss of external connectivity errors and the date and time those errors occurred. If Customer does not comply with these requirements, Customer will forfeit its right to receive a Financial Credit. If a dispute arises with respect to this TOS, CoreWeave will make a determination in good faith based on its system logs, monitoring reports, configuration records, and other available information, which CoreWeave will make available for auditing by Customer at Customer’s request.

### **Maximum Financial Credit**

The aggregate maximum number of Financial Credits to be issued by CoreWeave to Customer for any and all Downtime Periods that occur in a single billing month will not exceed 50% of the amount due from Customer for the Covered Service for the applicable month. Financial Credits will be made in the form of a monetary credit applied to future use of the Covered Service and will be applied within sixty (60) days after the Financial Credit was requested.

Customer acknowledges and agrees that any Financial Credits for loss or interruption of compute power, constituting a Downtime Period, shall be ratably calculated based on the Term of an Order Form and granted in accordance with the TOS.

### **Exclusions**

The Financial Credits do not apply to any: (a) features designated pre-general availability (unless otherwise set forth in the associated Documentation), (b) features excluded from the TOS (in the associated documentation), or (c) errors: (i) caused by factors outside of CoreWeave’s reasonable control; (ii) that resulted from Customer’s software or hardware or third party software or hardware, or both; (iii) that resulted from abuses or other behaviors that violate the TOS; or (iv) that resulted from quotas applied by the system, or (d) downtime caused by in-advance communicated maintenance. As applicable, Customer will only be entitled to Financial Credit for Downtime of a particular instance as either a Single Instance or Instances in Multiple Regions, but not both.

### **Intellectual Property Rights**

This TOS does not grant either party any rights, implied or otherwise, to the other's content or any of the other's intellectual property. As between the parties, Customer owns all rights in Customer Data (including all object and source code contained therein), and CoreWeave owns all rights in the CoreWeave Cloud Platform as a Covered Service and all CoreWeaveServices and related software (including third party software)

If Customer chooses to provide input and suggestions regarding problems with or proposed modifications or improvements to any of CoreWeave’s products and services (“Feedback”) then Customer hereby grants to CoreWeave an unrestricted, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, fully-paid, royalty-free right to exploit the Feedback in any manner and for any purpose, including to improve the CoreWeave Cloud Platform as a Covered Service and create other products and services.

Customer grants CoreWeave permission to include Customer’s name, logos, and trademarks in its promotional and marketing materials and communications.
