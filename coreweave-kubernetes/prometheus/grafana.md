## Self Hosted Grafana Instance

You can connect to Prometheus from your own Grafana instance. A Grafana instance can be deployed with one click via [CoreWeave Apps.](https://apps.coreweave.com) You can also connect your existing on-premise Grafana to CoreWeave Cloud's Prometheus service. The following steps need to be taken to add the Prometheus DataSource.

* Login as an admin on your Grafana instance and go to **Configuration** -> **Data Sources**
* **Add New Datasource** and select **Prometheus** as the provider
* Set the new **Datasource Name** to `CoreWeave`
* Under _HTTP Section_ set **URL** to `https://prometheus.ord1.coreweave.com`
* Click the "**Add Header**" button under the _Custom HTTP Headers_ section
* Set the first value (**Header**) to: `Authorization`
* Set the second value (**Value**) to `Bearer <TOKEN>` replace "\<TOKEN>" with your Access Token.
* Click "**Save & Test**" button to verify and save the new Datasource.
